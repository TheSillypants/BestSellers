* This data is going to be used to look at intended audiences based on assigned categories as well as the longevity of the books in order to see if there is a difference spoke as a group and reviewed the lists names from the categories and grouped them together. Elizabeth suggested a color coded scatter plot with each category being assigned a different color in order to visualize this data. Lucas suggested that we make a swarm plot instead to help visualize the different categories more separately. Alexis suggested doing a correlation matrix with all the data when we finish.
``` {r, attempting the swarm plot}
install.packages("beeswarm")
library(beeswarm)
beeswarm(fiction)

## I need to update my r markdown, just want to make sure I have some documentation that I did work incase it crashes
