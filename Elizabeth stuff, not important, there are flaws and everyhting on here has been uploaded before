#```{r, combing the data frame into a new one to make a ggplot- lucas helped originally, had to go and try again}
df2 <- data %>%
  select(list_name, category, weeks_on_list)
# this did not work originally because it did not include my categories, I tweaked how my categories worked and am retesting


#This data is going to be used to look at intended audiences based on assigned categories as well as the longevity of the books in order to see if there is a difference spoke as a group and reviewed the lists names from the categories and grouped them together. Elizabeth suggested a color coded scatter plot with each category being assigned a different color in order to visualize this data. Lucas suggested that we make a swarm plot instead to help visualize the different categories more separately. Alexis suggested doing a correlation matrix with all the data when we finish.

```

``` {r, attempting the swarm plot with the help of gg plot}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggbeeswarm)

#execution of the beeswarm hopefully
ggplot(df2, aes(x= New_Category, y= weeks_on_list, color = )) +

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
